* How to clone properly
I included my kickstart.nvim fork as a subpackge thus it needed to be clone as well...
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/linxichen/dotfiles.git
git clone --recurse-submodules ssh://git@github.com:linxichen/dotfiles.git
#+END_SRC

* How to deploy dotfiles
First make sure you cd to the root directory of this repo.

Using `stow`, we can deploy program configs one by one:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stow nvim -t ~
#+END_SRC

This command will copy everything under nvim directory to ~. That is, nvim/.config will be sym linked to ~/config, etc.

To delete or re-stow the package, do the following
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
stow nvim -D -t ~
stow nvim -R -t ~
#+END_SRC
